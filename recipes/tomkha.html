    <p>
      Tom kha is a creamy soup originating from Thailand. The most notable
      flavors are the lemongrass, galangal, and the kaffir lime leaves. The
      creaminess is from the coconut milk that we add. This soup is a milder
      version of Tom yum. In this recipe we will be using chicken, but you can
      use any other protein that you would like. In Thailand, they love adding
      in fresh seafood!
